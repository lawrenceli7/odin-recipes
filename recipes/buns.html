    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These steamed buns are yummy Chinese dim sum that can be made with or
      without meat filling. To make these tasty buns, you'll need a wok equipped
      with a stainless steel steam plate. After steaming the buns, make sure to
      remove the lid carefully so condensation doesn't drip onto the buns, as
      this will produce yellowish blisters on the bun surface. You may use milk
      in place of the warm water if you wish
