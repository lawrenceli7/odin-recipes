    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steak</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until
        the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices
        into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over
        medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not
        to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and
        remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding
        more oil as needed, and set the cooked meat aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak
        and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then
        stir in green pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and
        started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
